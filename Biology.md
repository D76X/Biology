1. Can part of a gene be separately mutaded? The alternative is that a gene is either mutant or normal. 

2. Can recombination occur inside a gene? The alternative is that recombination can occur only between genes.

3. Can crossing-over be detected between two independent mutations in the same gene?

- The answer to question 3 is yes: Bezer develop an experiment by which it becomes possible to detect crossing over between two independent mutation within the same gene. 

This fact leads to being able to find an answer to each of the questions 1 and 2 above.

- The answer to question 1 is yes: 

- The answer to question 2 is yes:
